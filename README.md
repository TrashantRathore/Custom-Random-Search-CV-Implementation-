# Custom-Random-Search-CV-Implementation-
Few Points regarding this code
1. This code involves custom implementation of Random Search Cross Validation without explicitly using sklearn library for it.
2. This code includes 10k random Samples from classification module inside sklearn.datasets.
3. This is a classification code using 2 classes and used K Nearest Classifier Algo for complete implementation.
4. Used Libraries are numpy, tqdm(for tracking sec per iterations), matplot, random and sklearn sub modules.
5. All the observations and references are written in form of comments.
6. Basic function code is written mostly in form of pythonic code.
